      <h1>My Love</h1>
      <p>
        From the moment our paths crossed, everything felt softer, warmer, lighter.
        You bring color into my days in ways I never thought possible. This little
        letter is just a piece of what my heart carries for you every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being you — for your kindness, your laughter, your warmth,
        and the quiet way you make my world feel like home.
      </p>
      <p class="ending">Forever yours,<br>❤️</p>
